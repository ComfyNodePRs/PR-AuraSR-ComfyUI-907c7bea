# AuraSR-ComfyUI
Very basic ComfyUI implementation of [Aura-SR](https://github.com/fal-ai/aura-sr)

Instructions:
- Create a folder name 'Aura-SR' inside '\models'.
- Download the weights AND config file and place them in 'Aura-SR'
- (Optional) Rename the model to whatever you want and rename the config file to the same name as the model (this allows for future, multiple models with their own unique configs)
- Using ComfyUI Manager install via URL
